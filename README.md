HTML boilerplate includes the <DOC! <html <head <title> <meta charset>>>> then the <body>

Start projects by creating repo on Git and copy the SSH for the git clone command

Always make sure to work from the directory you are intending to work from!

Setup Git by changing the default branch to main
    git config --global init.defaultBranch main

Use the commands:
    git status (log)
    git add (adds file to staging area)
        git add . (adds all files)
    git commit -m "..."
        no "-m" to open VS code instead
    git log
    git push
        git push origin main
